Here's a README file tailored for your Product Inventory project, based on the screenshot you provided and the "Study Hub" structure you liked.

Just copy and paste the text below into a README.md file in your project's root directory.

Product Inventory: A MERN Stack Application
Product Inventory is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed for managing a product database. It provides a secure, easy-to-use interface where authenticated users can add, view, search, filter, edit, and delete inventory items.

This project was built from scratch to demonstrate key MERN stack concepts, including:

Building a complete RESTful API with Express & Mongoose.

Creating a dynamic, multi-page frontend with React and React Router.

Handling complex state management with React hooks (e.g., for search and filters).

Implementing secure user authentication (implied by "Logout" feature).

Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products.

‚ú® Key Features
View Products: See a "card" view of all available products with their image, name, price, and stock.

Add Products: A dedicated form (likely a modal or new page) to add new items to the inventory.

Edit Products: Update the details of any existing product.

Delete Products: Securely remove products from the inventory.

Filter by Category: Quickly filter the product list by categories like "Clothing," "Electronics," etc.

Search Products: A live search bar to find products by name or other attributes.

User Authentication: (Inferred) Users must log in to access the inventory, indicated by the "Logout" button.

Responsive Design: A professional, clean UI that works on all screen sizes.

üì∏ Screenshots
(You should add your own screenshots here! You've already got a great one of the main dashboard. You might also want to add one of your "Add Product" or "Edit Product" modal/form.)


üõ† Tech Stack
Backend
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment

Express.js: Web framework for Node.js

PostgreSQL: SQL (Relational) database

pg (node-postgres): PostgreSQL client for Node.js (Or add your ORM like Sequelize or Prisma)

bcryptjs: For hashing user passwords

jsonwebtoken (JWT): For user authentication tokens

dotenv: For managing environment variables

cors: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing


Frontend
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Vite: Next-generation frontend tooling (bundler and dev server)

React Router (react-router-dom): For client-side routing

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests

CSS / Styled-Components / Tailwind: (Add whichever you used for styling)




üöÄ Getting Started: Local Setup
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Node.js & npm: Download & Install Node.js

MongoDB Atlas Account: A free MongoDB Atlas account to host your database.

Git: To clone the repository.



1. Backend Setup (product-inventory-api)
(Adjust folder names like product-inventory-api if yours are different, e.g., backend)

Clone the Repository (if you haven't)

git clone [https://your-repo-link.com/product-inventory.git](https://your-repo-link.com/product-inventory.git)
cd product-inventory


2. Navigate to the Backend Folder
 cd product-inventory-api

 3.npm install

 4.Database Setup

Create a new PostgreSQL database for this project (e.g., inventory_db).

If you have SQL script files for creating tables (e.g., schema.sql), run them now against your new database.

 5.Create .env File Create a file named .env in the product-inventory-api root folder. Add your database connection details and JWT secret.

# Example PostgreSQL Connection URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>

# Or, if using individual variables (check your db config file)
# DB_USER=your_user
# DB_PASSWORD=your_password
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_NAME=inventory_db

PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=yourrandomsecretkey

5.Run the Backend Server
  npm run dev


2.Frontend Setup (product-inventory-client)
(Adjust folder names like product-inventory-client if yours are different, e.g., frontend)

1.Open a New Terminal Keep your backend server running in the first terminal.

2.Navigate to the Frontend Folder From the root product-inventory directory:
  cd product-inventory-client


3.Install Dependencies
  npm install

4. Run the Frontend App
  npm run dev


  The React app will open automatically in your browser, likely at http://localhost:5173.

You now have the full MERN application running locally!

üåê API Endpoints
The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:
Method,Endpoint,Description
POST,/api/auth/register,Register a new user
POST,/api/auth/login,Log in an existing user
GET,/api/products,Get all products (can incl. search/filter queries)
POST,/api/products,(Protected) Create a new product
GET,/api/products/:id,Get a single product by its ID
PUT,/api/products/:id,(Protected) Update a product by its ID
DELETE,/api/products/:id,(Protected) Delete a product by its ID

üö¢ Deployment
(Add links to your live, deployed application here.)

* **Live Application:**https://invento-hub-54.vercel.app/

Note: When deploying, you must update the API base URL in your frontend code (e.g., in an axios instance) to point to your live backend URL, not http://localhost:5000. You also need to configure CORS on your backend to allow requests from your live frontend URL.
